Mixture modeling expresses probability densities as convex combinations of constituent probability distributions. In classical mixture modeling, the constituent density functions are assumed to be from some class of parametric distributions. Various well established algorithms, typically using expectation minimization, can optimally recover the weights, given an observed sample of values from the mixed distributions. In certain settings, however, mixture modeling is desirable, but the constituent distributions are neither known in advance, nor can they be assumed to be parametric. In this work, we demonstrate how, for discrete event spaces, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) can be effectively used to simultaneously recover both weights and constituent distributions, given a large collection of variably-sized samples from mixtures.
